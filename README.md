# LeetCode_StudyPlan-DSA-

**Leetcode** recently introduced a new feature called *Study Plan*. There are different plans available, like, Data Structure, Algorithm, Dynamic Programming, etc. You can choose any one of the plans and start making progress on that topic. Each plan is further divided into sub-sections, containing 2-3 questions as a part of the *daily challenge*. I am currently working on the **Data Structure Plan**, and here, I will update the solutions from my daily challenge.

*Hope you enjoy the journey of learning DSA* :)
